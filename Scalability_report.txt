# Future Scalability Scope of Disease Probability Project

## 1. Introduction
The **Disease Probability Project** is a Bayesian post-test probability calculator designed to estimate the likelihood of survival for a disease based on historical hospital data. It demonstrates the practical application of **Bayes’ Theorem**, providing an educational and interactive experience for understanding probabilistic reasoning in clinical contexts.

Currently, the tool supports a **single diagnostic test** input and calculates the posterior probability of survival. While functional as an educational resource, the project has substantial **potential for both functional and technical scalability**. This means it can evolve from a basic calculator into a comprehensive platform capable of handling large datasets, multiple input features, and advanced predictive models, while remaining open-source and accessible to students, researchers, and developers.

## 2. Functional Scalability

### 2.1 Multi-Test and Multi-Symptom Integration
**What:**  
- Extend the calculator to handle multiple diagnostic tests simultaneously, accounting for how different tests interact in determining survival probabilities.  
- Incorporate symptom-based inputs alongside test results for a more holistic assessment of a patient's condition, enabling multi-factor analysis rather than relying on a single test.  

**How:**  
- Expand `calculator.py` to compute **joint probabilities** using **Bayesian networks**, allowing multiple correlated features to influence the posterior probability.  
- Update the frontend with **dynamic forms** to accept multiple test results and symptoms, with user-friendly interfaces to add or remove inputs.  
- Introduce **weighting mechanisms** to prioritize inputs based on clinical relevance, test reliability, or historical accuracy.

**Impact:**  
- Users will be able to see a more **realistic survival estimate** that accounts for multiple diagnostic factors.  
- Provides a foundation for educational exercises in complex probabilistic reasoning.

### 2.2 Real-Time Hospital Data Integration
**What:**  
- Enhance prediction accuracy by using **live or regularly updated hospital datasets**, rather than static CSV files. This ensures predictions remain current with evolving clinical trends.  

**How:**  
- Replace static datasets with a **database backend** (SQL or NoSQL) capable of storing large volumes of historical and live data.  
- Implement **data pipelines** to automatically fetch, clean, and integrate new data from hospital records or public datasets.  
- Track data changes over time with **versioning**, allowing users to reproduce calculations from specific historical snapshots.

**Impact:**  
- Facilitates **up-to-date probability estimates**, increasing the relevance of the tool for research or teaching.  
- Supports scalability to **regional or hospital-specific datasets** for customized predictions.

### 2.3 Educational and Analytical Features
**What:**  
- Provide **step-by-step explanations** for each calculation, illustrating how prior probabilities are updated with new evidence.  
- Visualize the **prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions**, making the underlying Bayesian logic transparent.  

**How:**  
- Integrate **interactive charting libraries** (like Plotly, Chart.js, or D3.js) in the frontend.  
- Include **tooltips, collapsible sections, or guided walkthroughs** that explain each computation step.  

**Impact:**  
- Makes the tool a **valuable learning resource** for medical students, data scientists, and statisticians.  
- Encourages engagement by **demonstrating Bayesian reasoning visually**, improving comprehension of probabilistic concepts.

**How:**  
- Implement **i18n (internationalization) support** in Flask templates and frontend components.  
- Allow dynamic selection of datasets and priors based on **geographical or demographic inputs**.  

**Impact:**  
- Enhances educational reach for international students.  
- Supports **localized predictions** where disease prevalence and test outcomes differ by region.
